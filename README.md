## RAILS - Robust Adversarial Immune-inspired Learning System

### Platform
* Python: 3.7
* PyTorch: 1.5.0

### Intro
RAILS is a computational method to boost robustness of prototype robust DNNs. RAILS uses an Adaptive Immune System Emulator (AISE) for robustness.

### HOWTO
Run rails_cifar.ipynb, rails_mnist.ipynb, associate files include MAMLMeta.py, aise.py, pgd.py

### Commercial Application
RAILS has been filed as a patent. No commercial usage is allowed.
